abcsp - another bcsp stack
==========================

This implementation of bcsp is biased towards embedded environments; it uses
resources fairly frugally.  The consequent price is the need to integrate the
code closely with its environment, i.e., the code's operation and many
interfaces have to be well understood.

The primary reference for using abcsp is CSR document bc01-me-038.

The code was developed on unix.  This is reflected by the the Makefiles and
test programs.


config/   Directory holdling #include files that must be configured to
          match the local environment.

include   Directory holdling #include files that will not normally need
          to be configured to match the local environment.

src/      Directory holding sources of abcsp itself.  Disregarding the
          inevitable tiresome bugs, these files normally can be left alone.

make/     Common configuration files used by the Makefiles.
