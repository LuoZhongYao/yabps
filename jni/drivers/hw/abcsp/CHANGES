Version 1 of abcsp published on the CSR external web site approx. Sept. 2001.

============================================================================

Version 1.1 (CVS label abcsp-1p1) provided for publication on the web
site 18 June 2002.

Changes between version 1 and version 1.1:

ID AB.1  Added support for new version of BCSP-LE protocol, described in
bc01-s-010g.  This is believed to be backwards compatible with bc0x HCI
firmware builds since (at least) beta-10.  A #define can restore the old
version of BCSP-LE.  The new version of BCSP-LE is in HCI 15.X builds.

ID AB.2 Fix for bug - acknowledge reception of all reliable packets, not just
those that are currently expected.

ID AB.3 Fix for irritation (not really a bug) - don't report CRC failures on
received reliable packets with the wrong seq number.

ID AB.4 Fix for bug - if an attempt is made to write a tx packet's CRC at the
same time as the tx uart buffer fills then the tx packet may eventually be
sent with its CRC bit order reversed.

============================================================================

Version 1.2 (CVS label abcsp-1p2) provided for publication on the web
site 20 February 2003.

ID AB.5 Corrected comment advising normal periods for Tshy and Tconf.  
Changed from 2s to 250ms.

ID AB.6 Corrected calculation of BCSP header checksum in txmsg.c.
